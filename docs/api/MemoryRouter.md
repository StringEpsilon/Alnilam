# &lt;MemoryRouter>

The MemoryRouter component does not exist in Alnilam. You can instead use the default [`<Router>`](./Router.md) and 
pass it a history object from ```createBrowserHistory()``` from the history package.

A [`<Router>`](Router.md) that keeps the history of your "URL" in memory (does not read or write to the address bar). Useful in tests.
