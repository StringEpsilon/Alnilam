## withRouter()

withRouter() is a [higher order component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) that wraps one of your components to pass routing related props. A common use case is in [nested routing](../recipes/nested_routing.md), to access the current matching URL. 

### Parameters

| parameter | type                        | default   | purpose                         |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| Component | React.Component or function | undefined | the component you want to wrap. |

### Passed props

| prop      | type                             | purpose |
|-----------|----------------------------------|---------|
| location  | [Location](../types/location.md) | current location as reported by ```history``` |
| match     | [Match](../types/match.md)       | The match generated by the closesst ```Route``` or ```Match``` component |
| history   | history                          | The history object that is used by your ```Router``` |

### Example usage

```jsx
function LocationIndicator(props){
  return (
    <div>
      The current location is {props.location.pathname}.
    </div>
  )
}
const LocationIndicatorWithRouter = withRouter(LocationIndicator);
 
/* ... */
 
<Router history={history}>
  <LocationIndicatorWithRouter/>
  {/* Rendering the mundane 'LocationIndicator' would fail, since props.location would be null for it. */}
</Router>
```
 
### Caveats
 
0. Components wrapped with ```withRouter``` will throw an invariant exception if used outside a ```Router```.
1. withRouter updates / rerenders can be blocked by other components in the tree, as it has no subscription and instead relies on the default update behavior of React.
